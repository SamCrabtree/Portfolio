*Sam Crabtree's Personal Portfolio*

This project was created with two purposes in mind: 

1. To fulfill the requirements of Code Louisville's Front End Development Final Project

2. To help display my personal coding projects for external client or employer reference. 


This project will display the following techniques to meet project expectations-

## Git Comprehension
This 

## Media Queries

1. Show 2 different Media queries for different device types/screen resolutions (phone, tablet, and traditional computer screens) 
    This requirement has been met by starting with a "Mobile First" design. There is also a Tablet media query as well as a Desktop/Computer media query. 

## CSS Features

1. Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.
 
  This requirement has been met with the following features:
       A. The portfolio.html has a flexbox gallery of completed projects/assignments.
       B. The header/navigation menu across all html pages changes with media queries.  

2. A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

## Javascript Features

1. Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.



## Additional Features 

The following features included in this assignment are extra's and simply demonstrate techniques learned during class or from external sources:
